# Smart Research Assistant:

# Overview:
An interactive AI-powered tool that processes user-uploaded PDF/TXT documents and enables semantic understanding via:
Auto summarization
Intelligent Q&A with snippet references
Logic-based challenge questions + evaluation

#Technologies:
Built using Streamlit, BERT-based NLP pipelines, and PyMuPDF for accurate PDF handling.


# Features:
1. Document Upload
   Supports .pdf and .txt files.
   Processes PDFs using PyMuPDF (accurate and fast).
   Cleans and flattens text for downstream tasks.


2. Auto Summary
   Splits long documents into smaller chunks.
   Summarizes each chunk using bert-extractive-summarizer.
   Final summary is a composition of top N (default 3) chunk summaries.

4. Ask Anything
   Users can ask free-form questions based on uploaded content.
   Uses distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad via transformers.pipeline for QA.
   Dynamically selects the best chunk of text based on semantic similarity (BERT cosine similarity).
   Displays the supporting context (source snippet) for transparency.

4. Challenge Me
   Automatically generates 3 logic/comprehension questions.
   Questions are derived from meaningful paragraphs (ignoring intro/metadata).
   Each answer is generated by summarizing a key sentence, and evaluated using semantic similarity via sentence-transformers.
